Performs different statistical analyses depending on input sample, including sample mean, sample variance, sample deviation, construction of confidence intervals, and testing of null hypotheses.

Current Functions:

1) Statistical analysis including sample mean, variance, deviation, and size.

2) Construct confidence interval based on given population deviation (if unknown, program will estimate) and the desired confidence level. Currently no student table implementation.

3) Null Hypothesis Testing based on given hypothesis mean and relational operators for both hypotheses. Currently no student table implementation.

To begin, Launch the executable.

Enter your sample size.

Enter your sample values.

You will be prompted with the 3 aforementioned functions. Choose your desired instructions.

Follow directions. Be very careful to only input requested values. There is currently very few implemented exception catching/throwing mechanisms.

Enjoy :].


Future updates/addons:

more organization using OOP i.e. distribution class

Ask whether the user wants to provide the actual sample or the sample statistics

Provide applications for distributions i.e. Binomials, Normal, Bernoulli, etc...

Ability to automatically select function if it is the only name that matches what you have typed so far. I.E. Just typing the letter 'S' will automatically launch the Statistical Analysis function.

Exception catching/throwing.

Ability to read sample values from excel/text doc.

Ability to choose most accurate distribution based on your sample.

Ability to plot your data.

Ability to fit/print least-squares line based on your data.

Student table implementation for small sample sizes.

Joint probability mass function reading/analyzing function.

Pattern recognition, prediction algorithms.
